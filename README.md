## Simplex-Gabor Noise
Simplex-style noise modified to use a Gabor-like sinusoid kernel with variable direction and magnitude.

## Simplex-Style Noise with Neighborhood-Figure Kernel
Experimental simplex-style noise with a kernel that conforms to the lattice neighborhood figure instead of a sphere, to reduce the bubbly appearance, but without introducing discontinuities or accounting for more lattice points. May have a lower degree of differentiability.
